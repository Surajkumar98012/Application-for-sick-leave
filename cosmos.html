    	<h1>Cosmos</h1><hr/>
    	<p>The cosmos means universe.Using the word cosmos rather than the word universe imlies viewing the universe as a complex and orderly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System" title=" system is a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified whole. A system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries, surrounded and influenced by its environment, described by its structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning. Systems are the subjects of study of systems theory.">system</a> or entity; the opposite of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_(cosmogony) " title="Chaos refers to the void state preceding the creation of the universe or cosmos in the Greek creation myths, or to the initial gap created by the original separation of heaven and earth.

">chaos</a>. The cosmos,and our understanding of the reasons for its existance and significance,are studied in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology">cosmology</a>  - a very broad discipline covering any scientific ,religious,or philosophical contemplation of the cosmos and its nature, or reasons for existing. Religious and philosophical approaches may include in their concepts of the cosmos various spiritual entities or other matters deemed to exist outside our physical universe.</p>

        <h2><a name="Etmology"></a> Etmology </h2><hr/>
        <p>The<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher">philosopher</a>  Pythagoras first used the term cosmos (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language">Ancient Greek</a> : κόσμος) for the order of the universe.[2][3] The term became part of modern language in the 19th century when geographer–polymath <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a>  resurrected the use of the word from the ancient Greek, assigned it to his five-volume treatise,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_(Humboldt)">Kosmos</a> , which influenced modern and somewhat<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism">holistic</a>  perception of the universe as one interacting entity.
        	


        </p>
        <h2>Csmolology</h2><hr/>
        <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology">Cosmology</a>  is the study of the cosmos, and in its broadest sense covers a variety of very different approaches: scientific, religious and philosophical. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being. In this way, most religions and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">philosophical</a>  systems have a cosmology.

When cosmology is used without a qualifier, it often signifies physical cosmology, unless the context makes clear that a different meaning is intended.</p>
     <h3>Physical cosmology</h3>
     <p>Physical cosmology (often simply described as 'cosmology') is the scientific study of the universe, from the beginning of its physical existence. It includes speculative concepts such as a multiverse, when these are being discussed. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology">physical cosmology</a> , the term cosmos is often used in a technical way, referring to a particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime">spacetime</a>  continuum within a (postulated) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse">multiverse</a> . Our particular cosmos, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe">observable universe</a> , is generally capitalized as the Cosmos.

In physical cosmology, the uncapitalized term cosmic signifies a subject with a relationship to the universe, such as 'cosmic time' (time since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang">Big Bang</a> ), 'cosmic rays' (high energy particles or radiation detected from space), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background">'cosmic microwave background'</a> (microwave radiation detectable from all directions in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space">space</a> ).

According to Charles Peter Mason in Sir William Smith <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_Greek_and_Roman_Biography_and_Mythology">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology</a>  (1870, see book screenshot for full quote), Pythagoreans described the universe.[6]</p>
 <h3>philosphical cosmology</h3>
<p>Cosmology is a branch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics">metaphysics</a>  that deals with the nature of the universe, a theory or doctrine describing the natural order of the universe.[7] The basic definition of Cosmology is the science of the origin and development of the universe. In modern astronomy the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang">Bang theory</a> Big  is the dominant postulation.</p>
<h3>Religiou cosmology</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology">theology</a> , the cosmos is the created heavenly bodies (sun, moon, planets, and fixed stars). In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_theology">Christian theology</a> , the word is also used synonymously with aion[8] to refer to "worldly life" or "this world" or "this age" as opposed to the afterlife or world to come.

The 1870 book Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology noted[6]

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales">Thales</a>  dogma that water is the origin of things, that is, that it is that out of which every thing arises, and into which every thing resolves itself, Thales may have followed Orphic cosmogonies, while, unlike them, he sought to establish the truth of the assertion. Hence, Aristotle, immediately after he has called him the originator of philosophy brings forward the reasons which Thales was believed to have adduced in confirmation of that assertion; for that no written development of it, or indeed any book by Thales, was extant, is proved by the expressions which Aristotle uses when he brings forward the doctrines and proofs of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miletus">Milesian</a> . (p. 1016)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato">Plato</a> , describes the idea of the good, or the Godhead, sometimes teleologically, as the ultimate purpose of all conditioned existence; sometimes cosmologically, as the ultimate operative cause; and has begun to develop the cosmological, as also the physico-theological proof for the being of God; but has referred both back to the idea of the Good, as the necessary presupposition to all other ideas, and our cognition of them. (p. 402)
The book The Works of Aristotle (1908, p. 80 Fragments) mentioned[9]

Aristotle says the poet Orpheus never existed; the Pythagoreans ascribe this Orphic poem to a certain Cercon (see Cercops).
Bertrand Russell (1947) noted[10]

The Orphics were an ascetic sect; wine, to them, was only a symbol, as, later, in the Christian sacrament. The intoxication that they sought was that of "enthusiasm," of union with the god. They believed themselves, in this way, to acquire mystic knowledge not obtainable by ordinary means. This mystical element entered into Greek philosophy with Pythagoras, who was a reformer of Orphism as Orpheus was a reformer of the religion of Dionysus. From Pythagoras Orphic elements entered into the philosophy of Plato, and from Plato into most later philosophy that was in any degree religious.

<h2>Early views of cosmos: European and Chinese</h2><hr/>
<p>eastern and westesn thoughta differed greaty in ther understanding</p>
<h3>Europian view</h3>
<p>Early Europeans viewed the cosmos as a divinely created, spatially finite, bifurcated cosmos, divided into sublunary and superlunary realms. Objects above the lunar sphere were believed to be stable, with heavenly bodies believed to be made out of a refined substance called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintessence_(physics)">"quintessence"</a>. This was understood to be a crystalline, completely transparent substance that held all of the superlunary spheres in perfect order. After their creation by God, these spheres did not change except for their rotation above the Earth.[11] Objects below the lunar sphere were subject to constant combination, separation, and recombination. This was because they consisted of the chaotic elements of earth, air, fire, and water.[11]

The idea of celestial spheres was developed in the cosmological models of Plato, Eudoxus, Aristotle, Ptolemy, Copernicus, and others.[12] They believed in a stable cosmos created by God, where distinct realms were subject to different kinds of order. Europeans maintained the Aristotelian view that infinity could only be seen as an attribute of God, with the cosmos being finite. Furthermore, following the Aristotelian view that "nature abhors a vacuum", Europeans believed that the space between the spheres were filled with air.[11] This theory persisted until the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution">Scientific Revolution</a> , when the discovery that the Sun was in the center of the planetary system rocked cosmological understanding to its core.<p/>

<h3>Chinese view</h3>
<p>The Chinese had multiple theories of the processes and components of the cosmos. The most popular of these beliefs was the Xuan Ye theory, the astronomical view of the cosmos as an infinite space with floating pieces of condensed vapor.[11] The Chinese believed that the Earth consisted of condensed yin and the heavens of yang; and that these properties coexisted in constant relation to each other, with yin and yang being used together to explain processes on Earth as well of those relating the Earth in conjunction with the heavens.[11] This idea was described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Needham">Joseph Needham</a>  as a cosmos that functioned similarly to a complex organism, with discernible patterns in an ever-changing structure. There was both a pattern and a randomness to the cosmos.[13] Because of this, the Chinese believed that earthly phenomena could affect heavenly bodies.[11]

The Chinese believed that qi was the substance of all things in the cosmos and Earth, including inanimate matter, humans, ideas, emotions, celestial bodies and everything that exists or has existed;[14] and that it was qi condensing that created all the matter within the cosmos.[11] This is relatively consistent with our modern understanding of the congregation of matter through gravitational fields.[14]

The Chinese held a belief associated with the Xuan Ye theory, which held space as both empty and infinite.[15] This was inconsistent with the Aristotelian concepts that nature would not contain a vacuum, and that infinity could only be a divine attribute.[11] The idea of the nothingness of space was later recognized as one of the most important discoveries of modern science.[11]</p>

<h3>Similarities in observation</h3><p>
There is one way that both the Chinese and the Europeans, along with countless other ancient societies, related to the cosmos. This was through meaning, placed on celestial bodies, that were observed moving above the Earth. The Chinese had a very complex astronomical understanding of the stars and the cosmos that influenced everything from their art and architecture to their myths and science.[16] This was also true of the Greeks and Romans, whose 48 constellations, including the zodiac signs and the constellation of Orion, have been passed down to modern Western cultures. These were likely passed down to them from ancient Babylonian and Egyptian astronomers.[17] Copernicus is said to have been inspired by the fecund sun deity of neoplatonic thought, which may have initially inspired his vision of a heliocentric universe.[11]

While the spatial size of the entire Universe is unknown,[3] it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe, which is currently estimated to be 93 billion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year">light-years</a>  in diameter. In various multiverse hypotheses, a universe is one of many<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality">causally</a>  disconnected[11] constituent parts of a larger multiverse, which itself comprises all of space and time and its contents;[12] as a consequence, ‘the Universe’ and ‘the multiverse’ are synonymous in such theories.

The earliest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories">cosmological models</a>  of the Universe were developed by ancient Greek and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_philosophy">Indian philosophers</a>  and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center.[13][14] Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. In developing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation">law of universal gravitation</a> , Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus' work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe.</p></li>

Many of the stars in our galaxy have planets. At the largest scale, galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure.[15] Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then,[16] and is currently still expanding at an increasing rate.[17]

The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the Universe. Under this theory, space and time emerged together 13.799±0.021 billion years ago[2] and the energy and matter initially present have become less dense as the Universe expanded. After an initial accelerated expansion called the inflationary epoch at around 10−32 seconds, and the separation of the four known<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction">fundamental forces</a> , the Universe gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">Dark matter</a>  gradually gathered, forming a foam-like structure of filaments and voids under the influence of gravity. Giant clouds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>  and helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense, forming the first galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today. It is possible to see objects that are now further away than 13.799 billion light-years because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe">space itself has expanded</a> , and it is still expanding today. This means that objects which are now up to 46.5 billion light-years away can still be seen in their distant past, because in the past, when their light was emitted, they were much closer to Earth.</p></li>

This unseen matter is known as dark matter[18] (dark means that there is a wide range of strong<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstantial_evidence">indirect evidence</a>  that it exists, but we have not yet detected it directly). The ΛCDM model is the most widely accepted model of our universe. It suggests that about 69.2%±1.2% [2015] of the mass and energy in the universe is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant">cosmological constant</a>  (or, in extensions to ΛCDM, other forms of dark energy, such as a scalar field) which is responsible for the current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe">expansion of space</a> , and about 25.8%±1.1% [2015] is dark matter.[19] Ordinary ('baryonic') matter is therefore only 4.84%±0.1% [2015] of the physical universe.[19] Stars, planets, and visible gas clouds only form about 6% of ordinary matter, or about 0.29% of the entire universe.[20]</p>  </li>

The Universe is often defined as "the totality of existence", or everything that exists,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything">everything </a> that has existed, and everything that will exist.[26] In fact, some philosophers and scientists support the inclusion of ideas and abstract concepts—such as mathematics and logic—in the definition of the Universe.[28][29][30] The word universe may also refer to concepts such as the cosmos, the world, and nature.</p></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flammarion.jpg"><img src="old cosmos.jpg"></a><p>The initial hot, dense state is called the Planck epoch, a brief period extending from time zero to one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time">Planck time</a>  unit of approximately 10−43 seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state, and gravity—currently the weakest by far of the four known forces—is believed to have been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been unified. Since the Planck epoch, space has been expanding to its present scale, with a very short but intense period of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_inflation">cosmic inflation</a>  believed to have occurred within the first 10−32 seconds.[42] This was a kind of expansion different from those we can see around us today. Objects in space did not physically move; instead the metric that defines space itself changed. Although objects in spacetime cannot move faster than the speed of light, this limitation does not apply to the metric governing spacetime itself. This initial period of inflation is believed to explain why space appears to be very flat, and much larger than light could travel since the start of the universe.

Within the first fraction of a second of the universe's existence, the four fundamental forces had separated. As the universe continued to cool down from its inconceivably hot state, various types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particles">subatomic particles</a>  were able to form in short periods of time known as the quark epoch, the hadron epoch, and the lepton epoch. Together, these epochs encompassed less than 10 seconds of time following the Big Bang. These elementary particles associated stably into ever larger combinations, including stable protons and neutrons, which then formed more complex atomic nuclei through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion">nuclear fusion</a> . This process, known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, only lasted for about 17 minutes and ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred. About 25% of the protons and all the neutrons in the universe.</p></li>
